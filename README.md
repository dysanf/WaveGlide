WaveGlide Oxygen System
========================

WaveGlide is an automatic oxygen delivery system for glider pilots. It prevents hypoxia at high altitudes by adding oxygen to the inhaled air. Unlike medical constant flow systems it pulses the oxygen supply at the beginning of the breathing cycle and automatically adapts oxygen levels to altitude.
